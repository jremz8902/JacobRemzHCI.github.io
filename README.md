# Design Manifesto
This is my Design Manifesto website for my Human Computer Interaction course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
Here I will display the final results of the assignments I was assigned as part of the afformentioned Human Computer Interaction Course.

## About Me...
My name is Jacob Remz and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute taking [CS3041 Human Computer Interaction](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/) as taught by professor [Lane Harrison](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ltharrison/).

## The Design Procces
Professor Harrison has given us, his class, a new project to work on each week. I have choosen four of these one week assignments to highlight as examples of different aspects of my design process.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jremz8902/JacobRemzHCI.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
