## About Me...
My name is Jacob Remz and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute taking [CS3041 Human Computer Interaction](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/) as taught by Professor [Lane Harrison](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ltharrison/).

# Design Manifesto
As a result of my taking CS3041 with Professor Harrison I have developed my own personal design process:

 * Brainstorm Any and all possible ideas that tie into what you are trying to accomplish
 * Considering the tools and abilities you have available decide on a idea from the pool of brainstormed concepts
 * Use your tools and abilities to create something that satisfies what the user wants, maximizing the usability
 * Find users to test your creation, take notes based on their interactions
 * Repeat this procces as nessisarry

## Design Portfolio
Professor Harrison has structured CS3041 as a series of one week design sprints in which groups of students are expected to produce material focused around that weeks theme. I have choosen four of these one week assignments to highlight as examples of different aspects of my design process. The following are links with images and short desriptions of each of the four one week assignments.

### [Design For Others](https://medium.com/@john3r8amaral/design-for-others-3dfa42f7211c)

The goal of this projet was to redesign a local organizations website for mobile while keeping in mind a specific target demographic. We decied on redeisigning a local makerspaces, Technicopia, website and our demographic was "people in their 20s." The origional version of the website can be found [here](http://technocopia.org/) and the redesigned version of the site can be found [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/QFGHPYV2ZK5). This project is a good example of the use of the *Wizard of Oz* technique because we utilized [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) to stitch together images and to provide the small amounts of interaction we needed to fake a somewhat functional website. 

### [Design For Understanding](https://medium.com/@mariana0pachon/religiousness-and-income-of-us-regions-327de34debbd)

This project was a data visualization exersize and is a great example of that very thing. As a group we were responsible for two sets of visualizations. The first set of visualizations was intended to persuade the reader of something by presenting the information in a unique and interesting way, the second set was supposed to present the data in an impartial matter via easily interpreted and readable visualizations. For this assignment I was part of the subteam responsible for the second set of data visusalizations and to accomplish our goal we used the data visualization tool [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). Tableau allowed for us to easily (after a learning curve) create visualizations that facilitated viewers abilities to quickly interpret the differances that exist within the dataset we used.

This assignment was to create a chatbot to communicate with users about a contraversial topic. My group choose to use school uniforms as our debate topic and designed our chatbot so that it would side against whichever side the user choose. Our process behind the creation of this chatbot was hindered by the learning curve of the software we were using, but we used that learning time to preform user tests with the scripts we wrote for the bot to follow. To ensure usability would be high chatbot responses that were dependant on specific user messages provided users with buttons to use as their replies.
